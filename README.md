### Some workaround to have alerts to pokemons


For game PokemonGo some anti-TOS maps helps you to find those shiny and rare pokemons.

Since the beggining of the game this was something that Niantic wants to avoid, so they fight hard to ban scanner accounts and implementing diferent levels of API's, etc etc

After 5 months of game, they implemnt captchas, and with that, besides the server and domain costs people that are running this maps starts to see the bill to maintain this extremely high

Instead of getting a good group to share expenses, they create logins and protections to the maps and now you need to pay a high weekly/monthly value to have acess to the maps


For that i get a workaround and some good motivation to start learning python since this is my first project in that language
